# JSPlatformGame [ALPHA]

A simple platform game written in JavaScript and CSS

Based on http://eloquentjavascript.net/code/#15
My idea is to extend this game, adding new levels, new enemies and so on...

Work in progress... Absolutly unstable...

I'm working on this only when i have free time, for example on the train :)
