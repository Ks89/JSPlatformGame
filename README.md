# JSPlatformGame [PRE-PRE-PRE-PRE ALPHA :)]
A simple platform game written in JavaScript and CSS

Based on http://eloquentjavascript.net/code/#15
My idea is to extend this game, adding new level, enemy and so on...

Work in progress... Absolutly unstable...

I'm working on this only when i have free time, for example on the train :)
